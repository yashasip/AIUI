# AIUI
**An Experimental Idea to provide Graphical User Interface to Create, Develop and Train AI Models**

## Overview
- User can Train and Develop AI Models by Choosing the File or Dataset containing the Data.
- Further the Model Trained is used for Prediction/Generation based on the Input given.

## Developer Team
- [Yashas Ip](https://github.com/yashasip)
- [Avish D Shetty](https://github.com/avish-ds)
- [Shreyash P U](https://github.com/ShreyashPu)
- [Sweeney Mathias](https://github.com/sweeneymathias)

## Highlights
### The App includes Three key of AI Training/Prediction Interface
- ### Binary Classifier
  -  Model is Trained by analyzing the dataset given in the form of Spreadsheet or CSV file.
  -  The Developed Model is then used to predict the Probability of an event occuring based on the data.
  -  User can vary the different factors affecting the occurence of the event and can examine the change in the Probability.
  -  By entering the input one can compute the probability of an event occurring based on data.
- ### Image Recognition
  #### A pre-trained model is used to recognize the content in the image submitted by the user
    - Tagging: Detects the object present in the image can be person, dog, star etc.
    - Categorize: Image can belong to a certain Category like Animals, Flower, Human.
    - Facial Detection: Detection of human faces in the image and also predicts Age Group, Gender and Ethnicity.
- ### Text Generator
    - The Model is trained using the Dataset.
    - The user enters a starting word or a letter and hits Predict button. Text is automatically generated which is based on the model trained.

## Note
- Image Recognition requires Imagga API Key to work.
